# Contributing to Electron TypeScript Boilerplate
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue the pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be Public Domain
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Public Domain](http://unlicense.org/) license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/andreros/electron-typescript-boilerplate/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/andreros/electron-typescript-boilerplate/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408) of a bug report.

**Good Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific.
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or actions you performed that did not work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
