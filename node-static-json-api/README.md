Example of a RESTful API implemented in Node.js which retrieves static JSON for testing purposes.


## Prerequisites

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Node installation

Please, read the [Node.js official installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Installation).


## Installation

Clone or download this project. From the project directory run the command `npm install`.


## Run Your Application

To run your application, from the project directory run the command `npm start`. The API will
be started and accessible in the `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/` endpoint.


## API Methods

Note: Bear in mind the following methods are implemented for demonstration purposes. The `POST` method for creating a new task or the `PUT`
for updating a task accept no parameters (which in a real world situation they would). Please, refer to the code for the implementation
details.

| Verb | Endpoint | Description |

| `GET` | `/tasks/:taskId` | Retrieve one task details, given its ID. |
