Python Web Scraper is a personal project made with the purpose of learning the Python programming language while making something
that is both educational and usable in a real life or enterprise context. This project covers several aspects:

* How to create classes and inheritance in Python;
* How to write convenient header comments in files and how to comment code for automatic documentation generation;
* How to create a centralized configuration file for application variables and how use it;
* How to create packages in Python;
* How to run scripts with command line parameters;
* How to write unit tests for the code;
* How to create a project dependency requirement file for modern IDEs to interpret and automatically install needed dependencies;
* How to create a package for distribution of the project;
* How to generate project documentation automatically;

This project focuses on scraping pages like Google and OLX for now. It is not clear if any new scrapers will be included in the future.
The project relies on Selenium Webdriver for Python for the browser interaction process. In development or still to be done are the
following features:

* Implement the OLX scraper;
* Generate project documentation automatically;
* Write unit tests for the scrapers;
* Launch version 1.0;

## Motivation

This project was born out of the necessity of having to implement a web scraper for a enterprise project. As a way of consolidating and
deepen knowledge I decided to create this project.


## Requirements

### [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

### Browsers

The application supports the following browsers / drivers:

* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Chrome
* PhantomJS

In order to run the scrapers you will have to ensure that the browsers are installed in your system and the drivers for interacting with
them are installed as well.


## Installation

TODO:
[Describe the installation process. Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project]

Install Notes on Windows
- Chrome Driver
- PhantomJS Driver

Packing project: python setup.py sdist


## Usage

TODO:
[Write usage instructions]


## Code Example

TODO:
[Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by
looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise]


## Tests

TODO:
[Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples]
